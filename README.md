## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, the convenience of online services has become an integral part of our daily lives. The same holds true for booking tickets to events, movies, concerts, or any other form of entertainment. Recognizing the significance of this, I embarked on a journey of self-learning to create a cutting-edge solution that streamlines the ticket booking process. The result is my Ticket Booking Web Application, a user-friendly platform designed to provide a seamless experience for users.

At the core of this project lies a combination of modern web development technologies. Leveraging the power of React, Node.js, JSX, HTML, CSS, and Firebase, I have developed a dynamic and responsive web application that allows users to effortlessly browse, select, and purchase tickets for their desired events. With a simple and intuitive user interface, the application ensures a smooth and enjoyable booking experience.

## Overall Description

###	Product Perspective
Before undertaking this project, we studied the ‘Dress Code’ business using various methods. We have started working on this project after obtaining information from the higher officials of the institution and the officials working within the institution.  According to the information obtained from them, they had various software for running the business internally. But their main problem was to expand their business further while maintaining international relations. Therefore, their main request was to develop software to solve this problem. Therefore, upon their request, we took steps to create a suitable app for it. This software is not a modification or modification of any of their existing software. This is a brand-new software that we make for the business under a brand-new concept.
